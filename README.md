## What is Jack?

Jack The Butler is a self-hosted AI assistant platform designed specifically for hotels and hospitality businesses. It acts as a central orchestration hub that connects:

- **Guest communication channels** (WhatsApp, SMS, web chat, email)
- **Staff interfaces** (dashboard, internal messaging)
- **Hotel systems** (PMS, POS, housekeeping, maintenance)

Jack handles routine guest requests autonomously while intelligently routing complex issues to the right staff members with full context.
