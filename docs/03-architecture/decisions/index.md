# Architecture Decision Records

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for Jack The Butler.

## What is an ADR?

An Architecture Decision Record captures an important architectural decision made along with its context and consequences. ADRs help us:

- Remember why decisions were made
- Onboard new team members
- Revisit decisions when context changes
- Maintain consistency across the codebase
