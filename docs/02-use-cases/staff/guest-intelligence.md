## User Stories

- As front desk staff, I want to see guest preferences at check-in
- As a server, I want to know dietary restrictions before taking an order
- As a manager, I want to understand a guest's history when handling a complaint
- As concierge, I want to make recommendations based on past interests

## Ask Jack (Staff Query)

Staff can ask Jack questions about guests in natural language:

```
Staff: "What does the guest in 612 like for breakfast?"

Jack: "Sarah Chen (Room 612) is vegetarian and avoids mushrooms.
      In past stays, she's ordered:
      • Avocado toast (2x)
      • Fruit plate (1x)
      • Oatmeal with berries (1x)

      She also receives the Wall Street Journal with breakfast.

      Note: She's currently in service recovery from a noise
      complaint, so extra attention is recommended."
```

```
Staff: "Has Mr. Torres in 308 stayed with us before?"

Jack: "No, Michael Torres (Room 308) is a first-time guest.

      He's here for 2 nights on a leisure trip. His only
      preference noted so far is a tee time request for
      tomorrow (pending concierge follow-up).

      This is a great opportunity to make a strong first
      impression!"
