## Common Patterns

### Guest Identification
All use cases begin with guest identification:
1. Channel provides phone/email identifier
2. Jack matches to guest profile or reservation
3. If no match, Jack asks for reservation details
4. Context loaded for personalized interaction

### Escalation Triggers
Conversations escalate to human agents when:
- Guest explicitly requests human assistance
- Confidence score below threshold
- Complaint severity is high
- Request requires judgment (compensation, exceptions)
- Three failed resolution attempts

### Response Principles
- Acknowledge the request immediately
- Set expectations for timing
- Confirm completion or next steps
- Follow up if action was delegated
